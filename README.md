Hello! First of all, thank you for checking out my game! Before downloading, please note that this is early in development. Not all gameplay features have been implemented nor any visual appeal, though that'll probably be beyond obvious beyond launch. If you find any issues that are like in need of immediate fixing, or you just wanna chat, you can email me at [jaxsenhoneycutt@gmail.com](mailto:jaxsenhoneycutt@gmail.com "jaxsenhoneycutt@gmail.com")

# How to Play
## Requirements
- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Python 3.10")
- [Panda3D](https://www.panda3d.org/download/ "Panda3d")

## Running the Game
1. Launch the server by running `server/base.py`.
2. Launch the client by running `client/base.py`.

Currently, the game defaults to connecting to `localhost:9099`. If you desire to change this, change the values in `client/config.py`.

# Making Changes
Before making changes, I'd recommend taking a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/jaxsenh/the-devil-that-lurks/wiki), which contains information on how everything works.
